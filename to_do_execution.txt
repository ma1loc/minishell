## [readline]
    readline will read a line from the terminal and return it, using
    prompt as a prompt.  If prompt is NULL or the empty string, no
    prompt is issued.  The line returned is allocated with malloc(3);
    the caller must free it when finished.  The line returned has the
    final newline removed, so only the text of the line remains.

## [rl_clear_history] rl_clear_history(); // Erases all stored commands from history
    Function: void rl_clear_history (void)
    Clear the history list by deleting all of the entries, in the same manner as the History
    library’s clear_history() function. This differs from clear_history because it frees private
    data Readline saves in the history list.
    >>> summary
    
    The rl_clear_line() function clears the history list by deleting all of the entries. 
    The rl_clear_line() function frees data that the readline library saves in the histroy list.

## [rl_on_new_line] rl_on_new_line(); // Resets Readline's internal state to start a fresh input line (ctrl + c)

## [chdir]
    Changing the current working directory
    The chdir() system call changes the calling process’s current working directory to
    the relative or absolute pathname specified in pathname (which is dereferenced if it
    is a symbolic link).

## [stat]
    give you the same thing about the access can do buit with extra info like -> type, size, permission, etc.

## [lstat]
    lstat() is used for symbolic links, while stat() follows the link.

## [fstat]
    fstat() works with file descriptors, while stat() works with file paths.

## [unlink]
    unlink() removes a file from the filesystem. If the file is open, its data remains accessible until all processes close it.

## [perror && strerror]
    perror(): Directly prints to stderr.
    strerror(): Returns the error message string, and you must print it (typically using printf()), which will print to stdout.

## [isatty]
    You can use isatty() to check if the shell's input or output is connected to a terminal

Here's a list of error messages and exit status codes based specifically on how bash handles errors:

1. **Command Not Found** - Exit status: 127
   - "bash: [command]: command not found"

2. **Permission Denied** - Exit status: 126
   - "bash: [command/file]: Permission denied"

3. **No Such File or Directory** - Exit status: 127
   - "bash: [path]: No such file or directory"

4. **Is a Directory** - Exit status: 126
   - "bash: [command]: Is a directory"

5. **Not a Directory** - Exit status: 1
   - "bash: cd: [path]: Not a directory"

6. **Too Many Arguments** - Exit status: 1
   - "bash: [command]: too many arguments"

7. **Syntax Error** - Exit status: 2
   - "bash: syntax error near unexpected token `[token]'"

8. **Ambiguous Redirect** - Exit status: 1
   - "bash: [word]: ambiguous redirect"

9. **Bad Substitution** - Exit status: 1
   - "bash: [expression]: bad substitution"

10. **No Home Directory** - Exit status: 1
    - "bash: cd: HOME not set"

11. **Numeric Argument Required** - Exit status: 2
    - "bash: exit: [argument]: numeric argument required"

12. **Invalid Option** - Exit status: 2
    - "bash: [command]: -[option]: invalid option"

13. **Cannot Execute Binary File** - Exit status: 126
    - "bash: [file]: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error"

14. **Resource Temporarily Unavailable** - Exit status: 1
    - "bash: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable"

15. **File Descriptor Out of Range** - Exit status: 1
    - "bash: [fd]: Bad file descriptor"

16. **Variable Not Set** - Exit status: 1
    - "bash: [variable]: unbound variable" (with set -u)

Not a directory -> exit status = 1

Remember that in bash, general errors typically return exit status 1, permission/execution issues return 126, command not found returns 127, and syntax errors return 2. Signal terminations result in exit codes of 128 plus the signal number (e.g., 130 for Ctrl+C/SIGINT).

When implementing these in your minishell, you should print error messages to stderr (using `fprintf(stderr, "message")` or similar) and set the appropriate exit status with your shell's global status variable.
